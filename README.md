# TocDemo

This code is the result of Trihydro working with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) to migrate several custom mapping applications to the JavaScript framework. Along the way, we discovered a way to create a customized table of contents to fit client needs. This project is a result of that effort, and is being released as-is to help show how to create a customized TOC using the ESRI JS API 3.x and Angular.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

After downloading/cloning, run `npm install` to install packages. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
